# OkieMesh.org

Welcome to the official repository for **OkieMesh.org**! This project supports the development and growth of a mesh network community in Oklahoma using solar-powered Meshtastic radios. The goal is to provide a resilient, decentralized communication system that operates without reliance on external infrastructure like power grids, cell towers, or the internet.

## About OkieMesh

## Features
- **Mesh Network:** Decentralized communication through Meshtastic radios.
- **Solar Power:** Sustainable, off-grid operation.
- **Public/Private Messaging:** Flexible communication options.
